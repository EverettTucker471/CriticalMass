# critical_mass

The App of Conditional Connections

# Critical Mass is an event organization app that allows users to base their attendance off of someone else's attendance. 

With Critical Mass, I hope to...
* Build a dynamic graph GUI, that's a vertex-edge graph
* Integrate with a server for storing events and tracking user data
* Explore an interesting idea
